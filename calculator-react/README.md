# Calculator Project

This is demo calculator of Calculator App I created to demonstrate my skills.

There are things that are slightly overkill for such a simple project. (Like separating screen and buttons in different components)

But this was intentional to create prop drilling and showcase how I solved this problem.

Project is bootstrapped by yarn.
